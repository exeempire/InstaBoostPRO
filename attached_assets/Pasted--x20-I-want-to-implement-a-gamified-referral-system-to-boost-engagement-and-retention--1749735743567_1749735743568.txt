&#x20;I want to implement a gamified referral system to boost engagement and retention.

✅ **FEATURE REQUEST: "Referral Campaign + Reward Flow"**

---

### 1. 🎯 Homepage CTA Button

* Add a new **highly animated CTA button** on the homepage.
* Text: `Get 50% Flat Discount`
* Style: premium button using **Hope UI–like color scheme** (gradient, glowing, hover animation).
* On click, redirect to: `/referrals`.

---

### 2. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Referral Page (`/referrals`)

* If the user is logged in:

  * Generate and display a **unique referral code** like `REF-USERID-RANDOM`.
  * Show:
    `People who signed up using your code: X/5`
* When 5 users have signed up with that code:

  * Display a **"Claim Your Reward"** button (with gift-style animation/theme).
  * On click → redirect to `/reward-services`.

---

### 3. 🔐 Login Page Update

* Add a new input field:
  `Referral Code (optional)`
* On login/signup:

  * If the referral code is valid and hasn't been used by the user before:

    * Store the referral relationship.
    * Count it toward the referrer's progress.

---

### 4. 🛍️ Reward Services Page (`/reward-services`)

* Clone of existing `/services` page but:

  * Every service has a **"50% OFF"** badge.
  * All prices are reduced to **half** of the normal price.
* Same ordering flow as current `/services`.

---

### 5. ⚙️ Logic Notes

* Referral codes are **one-time use per referred user**.
* Backend should:

  * Track total successful referrals per user.
  * Allow access to `/reward-services` **only after 5 successful referrals**.
* Data schema idea:
  `Referrals { referrerId, referredUserId, code, status }`

---

### 📦 File Locations for Integration

* **Homepage UI:** `client/src/pages/home.tsx`
* **Referral Page:** New → `client/src/pages/referrals.tsx`
* **Reward Services Page:** Duplicate `services.tsx` → `reward-services.tsx`
* **Button Component:** Extend `client/src/components/ui/button.tsx`
* **Auth Logic:** Hook into `use-auth.ts`
* **Backend Endpoints:** Add to `server/routes.ts`
* **Database Logic:** Extend `server/db.ts` or `shared/schema.ts`
